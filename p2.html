        “Typography has something of a split personality &#8212; it’s both the
        technical act of writing words into the world by giving them form, and
        it’s also a way of understanding the world through the form of its
        writing.” <br /><br />
        &#8212; David Reinfurt, A *New* Program for Graphic Designer
      </p>

      <h2>Description</h2>

      <p>
        The look of a word has an enormous impact on how we understand the word.
        For centuries, typographers have explored and developed different ways
        to make type more expressive. Living in an era where computer
        programming has become increasingly accessible to designers, typography
        has adopted the principles of modular and parameterized design and
        became more interactive.<br /><br />
        For Project #2, you will pick three different words to create three
        interactive posters. Incorporate textToPoints() and / or classes and
        objects in the sketches. Your choice of shape, color, motion, and
        interaction should thoughtfully reflect on the meaning of the word.
      </p>

      <h3>textToPoints() Basics</h3>
      <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/embed/uznuyg8H"></iframe>
      <p>
        <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Font/textToPoints"
          >textToPoints()</a
        >
        is a function in p5 that converts text into points on the screen. It’s
        an exciting feature that will allow us to manipulate type in new and
        surprising ways. In order for textToPoints() to work, you have to use a
        specific font format called OpenType font (OTF) in your sketches. Here
        are a couple direct links for you to download OTF fonts:
      </p>
      <ul>

      </ul>
      <h4>
        Loading Font
      </h4>

      <p>
        Once you download the files to your computer, open the p5 web editor. Go
        to Sketch &gt; Add File and drag an OTF file to the dialogue box. Once
        it’s uploaded you should see the file showing up in your sketch folder
        on the left side of the editor.
      </p>
      <div class="full-width-box">
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/5dd99b18-3ebb-45c5-90fb-b4b67dc2e128%2FScreen%20Shot%202020-02-05%20at%2012.27.52%20PM.png?v=1580923684682"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        Now to load the font file, you need to create a global variable to hold
        the font and also load the font file from the preload() function.
        Comparable to setup() and draw(), the preload() function makes sure that
        your font is loaded before the browser loads the rest of the website.
        <br />
        <br />
        The preload() function should be placed before the setup() function:
      </p>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/044b9377547ce54ebf49269a3cd38a9c.js"></script>

      <h4>
        Displaying Font
      </h4>

      <p>
        Once you have your OTF font loaded we can begin to display it. You can
        simply do this by adding this line in your draw():
      </p>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/1068ef1f0b4c11223f722c6a93b1be31.js"></script>

      <p>
        Now let's intergrate textToPoints() into the progarm and convert the
        pre-exisiting vertices inside our word into points. <br /><br />
        To do this, you will need to create a new variable that holds the
        textToPoints() array:
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/69247c6c1441f18fc65f419086674b4d.js"></script>

      <p>
        There are five parameters inside the textToPoints function here. Let's
        break it down one by one:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>(1) txt: the first parameter takes a string of text</li>
        <li>(2) x: the second parameter takes a x position value</li>
        <li>(3) y: the third parameter takes a y position value</li>
        <li>(4) fontSize: the forth parameter takes a font size value</li>
        <li>
          (5) sampleFactor: the fifth parameter is the most important one to
          understand here. It defines how many points to draw along the text.
          The defacult value is 0.1, the higher number you enter here results in
          higher resolution, and lower number results in lower resolution
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Now if you print the variable <i>hiArray</i> in the program, you are
        going to get a funny message in the p5 console:
      </p>
      <div class="full-width-box">
        <img
          style="height:200px"
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/5dd99b18-3ebb-45c5-90fb-b4b67dc2e128%2FScreen%20Shot%202020-02-05%20at%201.40.37%20PM.png?v=1580928078985"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        Now let's open the web console inside the chrome browser and take a
        deeper look:
      </p>
      <div class="full-width-box">
        <img
          style="height:200px"
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/5dd99b18-3ebb-45c5-90fb-b4b67dc2e128%2FScreen%20Shot%202020-02-05%20at%201.48.19%20PM.png?v=1580928597513"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        Turns out that our <i>hiArray</i> variable has taken all the vertecies
        from the text and turned it into an array of objects. Each of these
        objects inside the array contains a variable x, a variable y, and a
        variable alpha. Being able to access these variables mean that we can
        also alter and manipulate them to make interactive type. Amazing!
        <br /><br />

        We have created a bunch of variables in the program, but we haven't
        drawn anything on the canvas yet. Since <i>hiArray</i> is simply an
        array of objects that contain all the x and y values we need to display
        the text, we can use a for Loop to pull all the x and y values out of
        <i>hiArray</i> to draw ellipses:
      </p>

      <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/sketches/7dPqCCYF"
        >Link to Source Code</a
      >

      <p>
        You can do A LOT by combining what you've learned so far. Try changing
        the ellipse into other types of 2D primitives and begin code sketching
        and creating iterations.
      </p>

      <h4>Changing Number of Vertecies</h4>

      <p>
        Once you've gotten comfortable with the ideas above, let's try changing
        the number of vertecies in your text. This can be achieved simply by
        changing the sampleFactor parameter inside textToPoints():
      </p>
      <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/embed/4jQwsJvN"></iframe>
      <p>&#8627; use UP / DOWN keys to adjust the number of vertecies.</p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/cb4c7a6e979a9c76f3b88fe7afc31602.js"></script>
      <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/sketches/4jQwsJvN"
        >Link to Source Code</a
      >

      <p>
        When you make changes to sampleFactor, just keep in mind that it's very
        sensitive, and most of the time you'd only want to make changes that are
        within a decimal range.
      </p>

      <h3>Connecting the Vertecies using beginShape() and endShape()</h3>

      <p>
        What if you want to draw the outline of the font by connecting all the
        vertecies together? A great function we could use is something called
        <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/beginShape"
          >beginShape() and endShape()</a
        >. These are the magical functions that connects all the vertecies you
        provide to the function into a complex shape. Usually it is written this
        way:
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/ccf95d1b4df306085e4617dca00a4209.js"></script>

      <p>
        But since we already have all the x and y information we need contained
        inside the <i>hiArray</i> variable, we could just use that inside
        <i>vertex(x,y)</i>. Here's how you would write it:
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/0882b4ed59087d0c575c064890cea1f6.js"></script>

      <p>
        And it creates this!
      </p>
      <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/embed/oAeVCLQl"></iframe>

      <p>
        As you can see, beginShape() and endShape() treats both "h" and "i" as
        one shape and attempted to connect both together. If you'd like the two
        to be separated, you have to create two individual textToPoints arrays
        to separate the "h" and the "i".
      </p>

      <h3>textToPoints Morph</h3>

      <p>
        Now that you know how to change the number of vertecies in a letter, we
        are going to try something exciting. What about creating a morphing
        effect that would transform one letter into another letter? <br />
        <br />

        There are couple steps we need to take here. First we have to make sure
        that the number of vertecies in the first letter matches the number of
        vertecies in the second letter, so that each vertex has an ending
        position to move towards. We will achieve this by tweaking the
        sampleFactor values of the letter one and letter two until they match.
