      <h2>Course Description</h2>
      <p>
        This course is an introduction to programming, the historical and
        cultural context of software in art and design, and the applications of
        “creative code” in a studio environment. Students will learn the
        fundamentals of all software development using the open source framework
        p5.js, writing programs that generate computational visuals and
        facilitate interactive experiences.
      </p>
      <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          (1) Demonstrate knowledge and application of fundamental programming
          skills in p5.js.
        </li>
        <li>
          (2) Develop a deep understanding of the relationship between code and
          design.
        </li>
        <li>
          (3) Manipulate data and text critically, via APIs, databases, and
          regular expressions.
        </li>
        <li>
          (4) Critically discuss and create work drawing from historical
          precedents of computational literature, critical design, and data
          visualization, as well as understanding the Internet as a site for
          potential intervention.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Required Tools</h2>
      <ul>

      </ul>

      <h2>Attendance Policy</h2>
      <p>
        Students are expected to be present and on time to class every day. Each
        unexcused absence after the second unexcused absence will result in a
        half-letter drop in your final grade (e.g. A- will become a B+). Three
        lateness will result in an unexcused absence. We only meet once a week,
        which means new programming concept needs to be covered in every class.
        If you miss a class, it is your responsibility to catch up with weekly
        slideshows and homework. The digital syllabus on Canvas will be updated
        with links after every class. Please review them and reach out if you
        have questions.
      </p>
      <h2>Grading and Evaluation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Attendance</b> <br />
          This can only work negatively for your grade as described in the
          attendance policy.
        </li>
                <li>
          <b>Participation</b> 14%<br />
          Verbal, critical, and informed participation in class. This means being present and aware — ready to contribute in real-time during both reading discussions and critiques. Personal phone and laptop usages are unacceptable for this class. 
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <b>Projects</b><br />
          Animation 10% <br>
          Interactive Typography 10% <br>
          Generativity 20% <br>
          Experimental Camera 20% <br>
          AI 20% <br>
        </li>
        
                        <li>
          <b>Public Events</b> 6%<br />
          You are required to attend at least two public events listed on the course calendar. Submit a report + response on the events you’ve chosen to attend.
