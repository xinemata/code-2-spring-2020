      <h2>Description</h2>

      <p>
        Modular design is a term coined by the West as a response to
        mass-production, however the idea has long existed in non-Western
        cultures as early as the beginning of written languages. Create a set
        number of 2D primitive shapes and transform them to compose three
        different images using p5 math and the switch statement. No shapes
        should be added or subtracted throughout the transformations. Please
        don’t use any color other than black and white for this assignment. Pay
        close attention to the positive and negative space each transformation
        creates.
      </p>

        (2) Add the “Embed” sketch link to the Project #1 Glitch page
      </p>

      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <h3>Setting Up Your Work Environment</h3>
      <p>
        You can make your coding experience a lot smoother and save a lot of
        time by setting up a healthy work environment. For example, when you're
        working with nested for Loop, it's a very good idea to draw and number
        all the grid cells on your canvas as things can get confusing really
        quickly. Here's a
        <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/sketches/ujBIbOWPj">template</a>
        I've created to help you get started. <br />
      </p>
      <div class="full-width-box">
        <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/embed/ujBIbOWPj"></iframe>
        <p>
          In the source code, you'd see that I have created a grid using a
          nested for Loop:
        </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/e49a9df08408b9758a2959078ffb4121.js"></script>
        <p>
          By looking at the numbers labeled on each and every cell, I can
          instruct the program to draw a diagonal line onto row 1, column 1 on
          the grid by adding <code><b>if(i == 1 && j == 1)</b></code> in the
          nested for loop. <br />

          The <b>const cellnum</b> variable defines the number of rows and
          columns and <b>const g</b> defines the width and height of the cells.
          When you use the template, change the values of these variables to
          draw a grid based on your own design needs.

        Korean characters are also modular by design. Each character is created
        from a comination of different Korean alphbets, separated into
        consonants and vowels: <br /><br />

        ㄱ ㄲ ㄴ ㄷ ㄸ ㄹ ㅁ ㅂ ㅃ ㅅ ㅆ ㅇ ㅈ ㅉ ㅊ ㅋ ㅌ ㅍ ㅎ<br />
        ㅏ ㅐ ㅑ ㅒ ㅓ ㅔ ㅕ ㅖ ㅗ ㅘ ㅙ ㅚ ㅛ ㅜ ㅝ ㅞ ㅟ ㅠ ㅡ ㅢ ㅣ<br /><br />

        By combining these alphabets into different configuration of "blocks",
        writing and reading emerges:

        >
        by <a href="https://www.moonjang.com/">Moon Jang</a> is wonderful
        example that utilizes the modular nature of the Korean characers. The
        clock contains a series of memorial signs that aim to commemorate
        Jongno, a district in Seoul where young people held street
        demonstrations and to reflect on the emancipatory time of Jongno. The
        signs consist of several words made out of Hangeul vowels and consonants
        – the Korean alphabet – that can be interpreted an aphoristic text, Now,
        Here, and Waiting / Dream, Labor, Language, Life, and What. In order to
        visualize the flow of time, the letters are attached to clock movements
        behind the front panel of the sign. In the design outcome, the letters
        constantly rotate on the front panel constructing and deconstructing the
        words, Now, Here, and Waiting / Dream, Labor, Language, Life, and What.
        It asks what we are waiting for to come here and now.

        Full disclaimer: I do not speak Korean and I'm only presenting one
        aspect of how Korean characters work after consulting with
        Korean-speaking friends and doing some of my own research. If you're
        curious, there is much more to the basic structure of the language that
        you could learn about
