        “Typography has something of a split personality &#8212; it’s both the
        technical act of writing words into the world by giving them form, and
        it’s also a way of understanding the world through the form of its
        writing.” <br /><br />
        &#8212; David Reinfurt, A *New* Program for Graphic Designer
      </p>

      <h2>Description</h2>

      <p>
        The look of a word has an enormous impact on how we understand the word.
        For centuries, typographers have explored and developed different ways
        to make type more expressive. Living in an era where computer
        programming has become increasingly accessible to designers, typography
        has adopted the principles of modular and parameterized design and
        became more interactive.<br /><br />
        For Project #2, you will pick three different words to create three
        interactive posters. Incorporate textToPoints() and / or classes and
        objects in the sketches. Your choice of shape, color, motion, and
        interaction should thoughtfully reflect on the meaning of the word.
      </p>

      <h3>textToPoints() Basics</h3>
      <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/embed/uznuyg8H"></iframe>
      <p>
        <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Font/textToPoints"
          >textToPoints()</a
        >
        is a function in p5 that converts text into points on the screen. It’s
        an exciting feature that will allow us to manipulate type in new and
        surprising ways. In order for textToPoints() to work, you have to use a
        specific font format called OpenType font (OTF) in your sketches. Here
        are a couple direct links for you to download OTF fonts:
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h4>
        Loading Font
      </h4>

      <p>
        Once you download the files to your computer, open the p5 web editor. Go
        to Sketch &gt; Add File and drag an OTF file to the dialogue box. Once
        it’s uploaded you should see the file showing up in your sketch folder
        on the left side of the editor.
      </p>
      <div class="full-width-box">
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/5dd99b18-3ebb-45c5-90fb-b4b67dc2e128%2FScreen%20Shot%202020-02-05%20at%2012.27.52%20PM.png?v=1580923684682"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        Now to load the font file, you need to create a global variable to hold
        the font and also load the font file from the preload() function.
        Comparable to setup() and draw(), the preload() function makes sure that
        your font is loaded before the browser loads the rest of the website.
        <br />
        <br />
        The preload() function should be placed before the setup() function. And
        inside setup(), you should load the <i>grotesk</i> variable inside
        <i>textFont()</i>. This tells the program that you will be using Grotesk
        as your default font.
      </p>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/044b9377547ce54ebf49269a3cd38a9c.js"></script>

      <h4>
        Displaying Font
      </h4>

      <p>
        Once you have your OTF font loaded we can begin to display it. You can
        simply do this by adding this line in your draw():
      </p>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/1068ef1f0b4c11223f722c6a93b1be31.js"></script>

      <p>
        Now let's intergrate textToPoints() into the progarm and convert the
        pre-exisiting vertices inside our word into points. <br /><br />
        To do this, you will need to create a new variable that holds the
        textToPoints() array:
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/69247c6c1441f18fc65f419086674b4d.js"></script>

      <p>
        There are five parameters inside the textToPoints function here. Let's
        break it down one by one:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>(1) txt: the first parameter takes a string of text</li>
        <li>(2) x: the second parameter takes a x position value</li>
        <li>(3) y: the third parameter takes a y position value</li>
        <li>(4) fontSize: the forth parameter takes a font size value</li>
        <li>
          (5) sampleFactor: the fifth parameter is the most important one to
          understand here. It defines how many points to draw along the text.
          The defacult value is 0.1, the higher number you enter here results in
          higher resolution, and lower number results in lower resolution
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Now if you print the variable <i>hiArray</i> in the program, you are
        going to get a funny message in the p5 console:
      </p>
      <div class="full-width-box">
        <img
          style="height:200px"
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/5dd99b18-3ebb-45c5-90fb-b4b67dc2e128%2FScreen%20Shot%202020-02-05%20at%201.40.37%20PM.png?v=1580928078985"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        Let's open Chrome's built-in debugging console to take a deeper look at
        these objects. You can open the console by going to View &gt; Develper
        &gt; JavaScript Console.
      </p>
      <div class="full-width-box">
        <img
          style="height:200px"
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/5dd99b18-3ebb-45c5-90fb-b4b67dc2e128%2FScreen%20Shot%202020-02-05%20at%201.48.19%20PM.png?v=1580928597513"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        Turns out that our <i>hiArray</i> variable has taken all the vertecies
        from the text and turned it into an array of objects. Each of these
        objects inside the array contains a variable x, a variable y, and a
        variable alpha. Being able to access these variables mean that we can
        also alter and manipulate them to make interactive type. Amazing!
        <br /><br />

        We have created a bunch of variables in the program, but we haven't
        drawn anything on the canvas yet. Since <i>hiArray</i> is simply an
        array of objects that contain all the x and y values we need to display
        the text, we can use a for Loop to pull all the x and y values out of
        <i>hiArray</i> to draw ellipses:
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/6eb2b2befa0e83f7a6af86999c9a1976.js"></script>
      <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/sketches/7dPqCCYF"
        >Link to Source Code</a
      >

      <p>
        You can do A LOT by combining what you've learned so far. Try changing
        the ellipse into other types of 2D primitives and begin code sketching
        and creating iterations. Check out more examples
        <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/sketches/J4M1_9jz">here</a> and

      </p>

      <h4>Changing Number of Vertecies</h4>

      <p>
        Once you've gotten comfortable with the ideas above, let's try changing
        the number of vertecies in your text. This can be achieved simply by
        changing the sampleFactor parameter inside textToPoints():
      </p>
      <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/embed/4jQwsJvN"></iframe>
      <p>&#8627; use UP / DOWN keys to adjust the number of vertecies.</p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/cb4c7a6e979a9c76f3b88fe7afc31602.js"></script>
      <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/sketches/4jQwsJvN"
        >Link to Source Code</a
      >

      <p>
        When you make changes to sampleFactor, just keep in mind that it's very
        sensitive, and most of the time you'd only want to make changes that are
        within a decimal range.
      </p>

      <h3>Connecting the Vertecies using beginShape() and endShape()</h3>

      <p>
        You might remember this childhood game called Connect the Dots. It is a
        form of puzzle containing a sequence of numbered dots. When a line is
        drawn the outline of an image is revealed.
      </p>
      <div class="full-width-box">
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/5dd99b18-3ebb-45c5-90fb-b4b67dc2e128%2Fcoloring4all-connect-the-dots-online-5a9ed8e88023b90036ec18e2.jpg?v=1581095294115"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        textToPoints() operates on a similar logic &mdash; it reveals the dots
        that crawl along the shape of the text. So what if you want to connect
        all the vertecies together using an outline? A great p5 feature we could
        use here is something called
        <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/beginShape"
          >beginShape() and endShape()</a
        >. These are magical functions that connect vertecies into a complex
        shape. Usually it is written this way:
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/ccf95d1b4df306085e4617dca00a4209.js"></script>

      <p>
        But since we already have all the x and y information we need contained
        inside the <i>hiArray</i> variable, we could just plug that information
        into <i>vertex(x,y)</i>. <br /><br />Here's how you would write it:
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/0882b4ed59087d0c575c064890cea1f6.js"></script>

      <p>
        And it creates this!
      </p>
      <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/embed/oAeVCLQl"></iframe>

      <p>
        As you can see, beginShape() and endShape() treats both "h" and "i" as
        one shape and attempts to connect both together. If you'd like the two
        to be separated, you have to create two individual textToPoints arrays
        to separate the "h" and the "i".
      </p>

      <h4>
        Morphing Using Classes and Objects
      </h4>

      <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/embed/pqrsbqcl"></iframe>
      <p>&#8627; click to "mop" the screen</p>

      <p>
        There are a couple benefits to combining textToPoints() with classes and
        objects. First of all, it could help with code organization. Secondly,
        you could add additional "behaviors" inside the classes which would be
        inherited by the objects, and each object can operate individually. If
        you need a refresher on how classes and objects work, check out this
        <a href="p5cheat.html">cheat sheet</a> or this
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-HGdc8L-7w">video tutorial</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now let's re-create the "MOP" sketch above. After loading and displaying
        an OTF font in a new sketch. Create a class below
        <i>draw()</i>:
      </p>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/f39b6ac87a2bfe52b64802771ce3873c.js"></script>
      <p>
        Notice that I've created two parameters <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> inside the
        constructor argument. Once we create an array of objects in the next
        step, we will take the x and y values from the textToPoints() array and
        pass them into constructor(). I've also created a show() method inside
        the class. We will be using these rectangles to draw the outline of the
        first alphabet.
      </p>

      <p>
        The next step is to create a global variable that is an empty array, to
        hold the objects for <i>class Alphabet1</i>:
      </p>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/60cc1bbc6b9c3b15b4ab4f1f923351a4.js"></script>

      <p>
        And create an array of objects inside setup() after textToPoints() is
        declared. This is where we pass the x and y values from textToPoints()
        into the constructor argument.
      </p>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/f3a48ab76f146cd7a004e9369b537773.js"></script>

      <p>
        The next step is to show the text outline on screen. Let's create
        another for Loop inside draw(), and place
        <i>_alphabet1[i].show()</i> inside the loop:
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/be41dbc4f0c64f9ee0d4b1acf0aaf4d9.js"></script>
      <p>
        You should see your first alphabet displayed on the screen. We've
        successfully "borrowed" the array of x and y from textToPoints() and
        plugged them into class and objects. Here is
        <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/sketches/zm_-6pJJ"
          >a link to all the code I've written so far</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are three alphabets in this example &mdash; "M", "O", "P". We have
        finished the setup for M. The next challenge is for you to repeat the
        steps to set up O and P. Don't forget to adjust the
        <i>sampleFactor</i> for each of the letter so that the numbers of
        vertecies match.
      </p>

      <p>
        ... ... ...
      </p>

      <p>
        Once you're done with that, let's begin to code our M &mdash; O
        transformation. This works the same way as the previous morphing
        tutorial, except for the sake of organization, I'm going to place this
        block of code a function called <i>morph1</i>.
      </p>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/49fa9bf06e2b129ce935d2cbaceef867.js"></script>

      <p>
        Load <i>morph1()</i> inside draw() and you should see M morphing into O.
        Your next challenge is to repeat the steps and create the O &mdash; P
        transformation inside <i>morph2()</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        ... ... ...
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, let's use the switch statement we've learned from Project #1 as a

      <p>
        Now you should be able to morph from M &mdash; O &mdash; P. But for an
        interactive project to be effective and not look broken, you should find
        a way for P to loop back to M instead of stopping. Can you figure out
        how to make the sketch loop? (hint: there are more than one answers)

      <p>
        We have been using the Cartesian coordinate system in p5.js, where every
        position is described by its x and y values on the plane. Contrary to
        the Cartesian coordinate system, the polar coordinate system describes
        the position using (1) distance from the center and (2) degrees of
        angle. The syntax for the polar coordinate system is (distance from the
        center, degrees of angle).
